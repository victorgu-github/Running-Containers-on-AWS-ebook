# Ebook: Running-Containers-on-AWS
-Building Scalable and Resilient Containerized Applications with Continuous Delivery and Infrastructure as Code    

## Book Description
Running containers in AWS provides the added benefit of leveraging the power of the AWS cloud while taking advantage of the benefits of containers technology. By mastering AWS container services like Amazon ECS, EKS, and Fargate, you can streamline your development and deployment processes and deliver reliable, scalable applications.
By supporting portability, consistency and efficiency, Containers technology becomes a valuable tool for organizations that need to develop and deploy applications quickly and reliably across different environments. Additionally, the rise of cloud computing and microservices architectures has increased the demand for containers as a way to manage and orchestrate complex distributed systems.
This book is a comprehensive guide that teaches how to run and manage containers on AWS by leveraging all the best practices learned from years of customer interactions. You will learn about the container service landscape on AWS, understand the features of each service and then be able to pick the proper services for your needs. You will get a deeper understanding on how Amazon ECS, EKS and Fargate support containers in terms of scalability, availability, agility and security. Filled with real-world examples, the book shows how to deploy container platforms quickly, consistently, and reliably using Infrastructure as Code and observe platform data using monitoring and logging tools.
By the end of this book you will effectively set up container platforms in AWS using IaC tools and deploy containerized applications with CI/CD or GitOps tools.

## Who this book is for
